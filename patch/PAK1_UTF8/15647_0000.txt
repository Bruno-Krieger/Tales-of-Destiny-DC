...Oh, damn!
[ENDBLOCK]
It's disgraceful of a Lens Hunter
to fall for such a simple trap.
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, so <Rutee> used to be a Lens Hunter?
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right. I'll go anywhere for the lens.
I'll go for it, no matter the risk!
[ENDBLOCK]
...That's how Lens Hunters live.
[ENDBLOCK]
If you're trapped by it, you have no choice.
[ENDBLOCK]
That was! Oh...it was just a slip.
I'm usually more dashing than that.<x00>
